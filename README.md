# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to combat credit card fraud by implementing and rigorously evaluating cutting-edge solutions. We have implemented various models, performed undersampling, SMOTE, and compared their performance to identify the most effective approach.

## Key Features

- Implementation and evaluation of state-of-the-art fraud detection models.
- Utilization of undersampling and SMOTE techniques to handle imbalanced datasets.
- Comparison of model performance to assess efficacy in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Model Evaluation

We have rigorously evaluated different models, considering metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. The evaluation process involved cross-validation and comparison of results to identify the best-performing model.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CreditCardFraudDetection.git
